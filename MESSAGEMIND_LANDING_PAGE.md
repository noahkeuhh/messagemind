Threshold: 0.2 (20% visible)
Animation: opacity 0→1, translateY(20px)→0
Duration: 400ms
Easing: ease-out

Interest bar trigger:
Threshold: 0.5 (50% visible)

Button hover:
No observer needed
CSS :hover state
Transition: 200 and up
Tablet: 768px to 1279px

- Hide less critical content

Tablet:
- 2-column grids
- Padding 32px (left/right), 64px (top/bottom)
- Hybrid layouts (some stack, some grid)

Desktop:
- Full multi-column grids
- Padding 24px (left/right), content max-width 1280px
- All features visible
- Side-by-side layouts

Touch targets on mobile:

## Performance Notes

Images:
Use WebP format with PNG/JPG fallback
Lazy load images below fold
Max file size 150KB per image

Fonts:
Self-host fonts or use system font fallbacks
Load only weights needed (400, 500, 600, 700)
Use font-display: swap

Animations:
Use transform and opacity only (GPU accelerated)
Avoid animating width/height/top/left
Use will-change sparingly

JavaScript:
Defer non-critical scripts
Use Intersection Observer for scroll triggers
Debounce scroll/resize events
